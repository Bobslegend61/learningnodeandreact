Javascript projects for learning node and react.

So i'm a self thought developer following on tutorials for a long time but still having the imposter syndrom (Always feel like i'm not ready to apply for a job). But F\*\*k it i'm just gonna do it anyways, so i'm trying to build a portfolio before applying and i need some projects on it. Found these project ideas on [medium](https://medium.com/@george.af.field/javascript-projects-for-learning-node-and-react-5bd38a857f40) by [George Field](https://medium.com/@george.af.field).  
I'll be working on these series of projects and more, Links below ðŸ‘‡
