# User

## Build A REST API that interacts with MongoDB

Create a REST API that allows you to create, update, delete and retrieve user data. The user data should be stored in MongoDB.

`Difficulty`: Easy - Medium

### User Object

use the following object as a user object:

```JSON
{
    "id": 0,
    "firstName": "",
    "lastName": "",
    "age": 0,
    "gender": "",
    "tandcs": false,
    "email": ""
}
```

End point is gonna perform the following `CRUD` operation.

- Get a user by id.
- Creates a user
- Updates a user by id.
- Removes a user by id.
